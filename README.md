9. NEW SECTION ADDED — CSS Implementation Notes

This section outlines how to structure and include CSS for the Pick n Pay site. Use a modular, maintainable approach with a base stylesheet and component-specific files:

Recommended CSS File Structure

base.css — reset, variables, typography

layout.css — grid, header, footer, containers

components.css — cards, banners, buttons

forms.css — inputs, labels, messages

Accessibility & Performance Guidelines

Use system or web-safe fallback fonts for faster loading

Minify and concatenate CSS for production

Prefer CSS variables:

--brand-red

--brand-blue

--brand-white

Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio between text and background

Respect reduced-motion using:

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    * {
        animation: none !important;
        transition: none !important;
    }
}

10. Screenshots & Documentation Guidelines (new)
Provide clear screenshots to document the site’s UI and flows. Use consistent naming and record metadata for each image.

Screenshot types to capture:

Homepage (desktop & mobile)

Product listing page

Product detail page (with variant selector)

Cart and checkout flow (each checkout step)

Smart Shopper / loyalty sign-up modal

Store locator map and results

Contact / enquiry form confirmation

File naming convention (recommended): ---.png — e.g. homepage-desktop-v1.png, checkout-mobile-step2-v1.png.

Resolution & format:

Desktop: 1366×768 or 1440×900 (PNG)

Mobile: 375×812 (iPhone X style) or 360×800 (Android)

Use PNG for UI screenshots; use WebP for smaller size if supported in documentation hosting.
