    <h2>About Us</h2>

He purchased four small stores in Cape Town and built them into a major supermarket chain, which later went public in 1968. Today, Pick n Pay operates through various store formats, including Pick n Pay and Boxer, and has a significant online presence. The company also has a presence in several other African countries and owns a stake in Zimbabwean supermarket chain, TM Supermarkets.</p>
